# 🌐 **NETWORKING 101 — TEACH MODE**





## 🔵 **1. Request–Response Cycle (VERY IMPORTANT)**
When you type a URL like **amazon.in**:




# ___________________________________
1️⃣ **Client Sends Request**
# ___________________________________

* Your browser sends a request to the server.
* Request contains:

  * URL
  * Method (GET, POST…)
  * Headers
  * Body (only for POST/PUT)

2️⃣ **Server Processes the Request**

* Server checks routes, DB, business logic.

3️⃣ **Server Sends Response**

* Response includes:

  * Status code (200, 404…)
  * Headers
  * Response body (HTML/JSON)

4️⃣ **Browser Renders Results**

### ✔ Simple Example

```
Client: GET /products
Server: 200 OK + product list











```

# ___________________________________
# 🟧 **2. OSI Model (7 Layers) 
# ___________________________________

OSI = **Open Systems Interconnection**
It explains *how data travels* from one computer to another.






### ✔ 7 Layers Mnemonic:

**"Please Do Not Throw Sausage Pizza Away"**

| Layer | Name             | Simple Meaning                       |
| ----- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| 7     | **Application**  | Apps use network (browser, WhatsApp) |
| 6     | **Presentation** | Encryption, compression (SSL, JPEG)  |
| 5     | **Session**      | Start/end communication              |
| 4     | **Transport**    | TCP/UDP, port numbers                |
| 3     | **Network**      | IP addresses, routing                |
| 2     | **Data Link**    | MAC address, switches                |
| 1     | **Physical**     | Cables, WiFi signals                 |




### ✔ Example:

When you open google.com:

* Layer 7: Browser request
* Layer 4: TCP creates connection
* Layer 3: Finds IP
* Layer 1: Sends as electrical signals/WiFi

---

# **3. HTTP vs HTTPS**

| Feature    | HTTP                | HTTPS                    |
| ---------- | ------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Security   | ❌ Not secure        | ✔ Encrypted              |
| Port       | 80                  | 443                      |
| Encryption | None                | SSL/TLS                  |
| Use Case   | Non-sensitive sites | Banking, login, payments |



### ✔ Real Example

* [http://example.com](http://example.com)
            → open communication


* [https://example.com](https://example.com) 
            → secure communication




---

# 🟣 **4. IP, DNS, Port — The Addressing System of Internet**

### 🔹 **IP Address**

* Unique address of a device on the network
  Example: `142.250.193.78` (Google)

### 🔹 **DNS (Domain Name System)**

Converts domain names → IP addresses
Example:

```
google.com → 142.250.193.78
```

### 🔹 **Port Numbers**

Ports identify **different services** running on same machine.

| Service    | Port |
| ---------- | ---- |
| HTTP       | 80   |
| HTTPS      | 443  |
| MySQL      | 3306 |
| PostgreSQL | 5432 |
| Redis      | 6379 |











### ✔ Example:

```
Client → 157.240.20.35:443  
(which is Facebook’s HTTPS port)
```

---

# 🔵 **5. Status Codes (HTTP Response Codes)**

| Code    | Meaning      | Example          |
| ------- | ------------ | ---------------- |
| **200** | OK           | page loaded      |
| **201** | Created      | new record added |
| **400** | Bad Request  | wrong input      |
| **401** | Unauthorized | login required   |
| **403** | Forbidden    | not allowed      |
| **404** | Not Found    | URL wrong        |
| **500** | Server Error | bug in server    |

### ✔ Simple Example

```
GET /users/10 → 404 (if user not found)
POST /users → 201 (if user created)
```

---





# 🏗 **ARCHITECTURES**

## 🟦 **1. MVC (Model–View–Controller)**

Used in: Spring MVC, Ruby on Rails, Laravel

### ✔ Meaning

* **Model** — Database layer
* **View** — UI (HTML)
* **Controller** — Receives request & returns response

### 📘 Example

```
User → Controller → Model → DB → View → Browser
```

### ✔ Real-life Example

You open: `/products`

* **Controller**: product_controller.py
* **Model**: product.py
* **View**: products.html

---

## 🟩 **2. MVT (Model–View–Template)**

Used in: **Django**

### ✔ MVT Flow

* **Model** — Database structure
* **View** — Python function returning data
* **Template** — HTML file with placeholders

### 📘 Example

You visit `/profile`

* **View**: profile_view()
* **Model**: User model
* **Template**: profile.html

### ✔ Difference from MVC

In MVC, **View = UI**
In MVT, **Template = UI**, and *Django handles Controller internally*.

# 🎈 **ELI5 — Explain Like I’m 5 Years Old**

Imagine you are hungry and want biscuits.
You go to a shop and ask:

**You:** “Uncle, biscuits please!”
**Shop Uncle:** “Here are your biscuits!”

This is exactly how the internet works.

### ✔ When you type **amazon.in**:

### **1️⃣ You (Browser) ask the shop (Server):**

“Can you give me the Amazon homepage?”

### **2️⃣ Shop Uncle (Server) checks where biscuits are kept:**

He looks in the store (database, logic, files).

### **3️⃣ Shop Uncle gives you biscuits (Response):**

He gives:

* The biscuits (HTML page)
* A note saying “Everything OK” (Status code 200)

### **4️⃣ You (Browser) open the packet:**

And show biscuits nicely on your screen → the webpage.

# 🧠 **FIRST PRINCIPLES — Build From the Ground Up**

Let’s break the entire idea into smallest possible concepts.

## 🔹 **Fundamental Truth 1: Your browser cannot show anything without asking a server.**

A browser is just a viewer.
To show data, it must **ask**.

This “asking” is called a **request**.

---

## 🔹 **Fundamental Truth 2: A server is a computer that waits for requests.**

A server is not magic.
It’s just another computer that:

* Listens
* Understands
* Responds

---

## 🔹 **Fundamental Truth 3: Communication must follow rules (HTTP).**

Like traffic rules, computers need a protocol.

That protocol is **HTTP**.

It defines things like:

* How to ask? (GET, POST)
* What info to send? (Headers, body)
* How to reply? (Status code, body)

---

## 🔹 **Fundamental Truth 4: Every request MUST receive a response.**

A request without response = error / timeout.

So the cycle is mandatory.

---

# 🔵 **Now build the full cycle logically**

### **Step 1: Browser → Server (Request)**

“Hey server, give me this page.”

Includes:

* URL
* Method
* Headers
* Body (only for POST)

---

### **Step 2: Server Thinks**

“Which page is this?”
“Which function should run?”
“Do I need database?”

The server processes the request.

---

### **Step 3: Server → Browser (Response)**

Server sends:

* A status code
* Headers
* Actual content (HTML / JSON / etc.)

---

### **Step 4: Browser Draws Everything**

HTML → visible website
CSS → colors
JS → buttons working

---

# ✔ Simple Example Using First Principles

### **Request**

```
GET /products
```

Meaning:
“Give me the list of products.”

### **Response**

```
200 OK
[ {“id”:1, “name”:”Shirt”}, {“id”:2, “name”:”Shoes”} ]
```

Meaning:
“Here! Everything is fine. Take your product list.”

---

# 🎯 Final 1-Line Summary

**The Request–Response cycle is just one computer asking for information and another computer replying with that information.**

---

If you want, I can also explain this with:

📌 A diagram
📌 A real-world story
📌 Code example (Flask / Django / Node.js)

Just tell me which one!












Absolutely! Let’s break these **three networking concepts** into:

### ✔ **ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5)**

### ✔ **FIRST PRINCIPLES (Build from zero)**

---

# 🎈 **ELI5 — Explain Like I’m 5 Years Old**

Imagine you’re sending a letter to a shop asking for chocolates.

---

## 🟦 **1. How to ask? (GET, POST)**

This is like choosing what *type* of letter you send.

### ✔ GET = Asking for something

You write:
“Uncle, show me what chocolates you have.”

### ✔ POST = Sending something

You write:
“Uncle, here is my chocolate order.”
(You give details like flavor, quantity, name)

So GET → asking
POST → giving

---

## 🟩 **2. What info to send? (Headers, Body)**

### ✔ Headers = The envelope

You write things on the envelope:

* Who is sending?
* What language?
* What format?

Browser does the same:

* User-Agent
* Content-Type
* Authorization

Think of headers like **instructions written on the outside**.

---

### ✔ Body = The letter inside

The body contains the actual message.

Example:
POST body:

```
name: Poovarasan
item: chocolate
quantity: 2
```

GET usually has **no body**. It’s just a simple request.

---

## 🟥 **3. How to reply? (Status code, Body)**

When the shop uncle replies:

### ✔ Status Code = A stamp on the envelope

* 200 → Everything is OK
* 404 → I didn’t find your item
* 500 → I made a mistake inside shop

### ✔ Response Body = The chocolates or message inside

This is the actual *data* you receive.

For example:

```
Here are the chocolates you asked.
```

---

# 🧠 **FIRST PRINCIPLES — Build From Zero**

Let’s break each idea into its smallest truth.

---

# 🟦 **1. How to ask? (GET, POST)**

### Fundamental truth:

Computers need a structured way to communicate.

Like:

* GET → Only ask
* POST → Send something

These are called **HTTP Methods**.

They shape the *intention* of communication.

---

# 🟩 **2. What info to send? (Headers, Body)**

### Fundamental truth:

When two machines talk, they must exchange details.

### ✔ Headers = Metadata

Information *about* the request.

Examples:

* Which language you understand?
* What format you expect (JSON, HTML)?
* Are you logged in?

These help the server interpret your request.

### ✔ Body = Actual data

When you're submitting something:

* Form data
* JSON
* Image file
* Login details

The body carries the **content**.

---

# 🟥 **3. How to reply? (Status Code, Body)**

### Fundamental truth:

Servers must always tell the client **what happened**.

### ✔ Status Code = Quick summary

3-digit number summarizing the result.

Examples:

* 200 → Success
* 400 → You made mistake
* 403 → You’re not allowed
* 404 → I can’t find it
* 500 → Server failed

### ✔ Response Body = Actual result

This contains:

* HTML page
* JSON
* Error message

The client uses this to update the screen.

# 🧠 **FIRST PRINCIPLES — Build From Zero**

Let’s break each idea into its smallest truth.

---

# 🟦 **1. How to ask? (GET, POST)**

### Fundamental truth:

Computers need a structured way to communicate.

Like:

* GET → Only ask
* POST → Send something

These are called **HTTP Methods**.

They shape the *intention* of communication.

---

# 🟩 **2. What info to send? (Headers, Body)**

### Fundamental truth:

When two machines talk, they must exchange details.

### ✔ Headers = Metadata

Information *about* the request.

Examples:

* Which language you understand?
* What format you expect (JSON, HTML)?
* Are you logged in?

These help the server interpret your request.

### ✔ Body = Actual data

When you're submitting something:

* Form data
* JSON
* Image file
* Login details

The body carries the **content**.

---

# 🟥 **3. How to reply? (Status Code, Body)**

### Fundamental truth:

Servers must always tell the client **what happened**.

### ✔ Status Code = Quick summary

3-digit number summarizing the result.

Examples:

* 200 → Success
* 400 → You made mistake
* 403 → You’re not allowed
* 404 → I can’t find it
* 500 → Server failed

### ✔ Response Body = Actual result

This contains:

* HTML page
* JSON
* Error message

The client uses this to update the screen.

# 🟦 **REAL-TIME EXAMPLE: Ordering Food on Swiggy/Zomato**

### You open Swiggy and search for “pizza.”

This triggers a **GET request**.

---

# 🍕 **1️⃣ GET Request (How to Ask)**

Your phone sends:

```
GET /search?item=pizza
```

Meaning:
“Hey server, show me all pizza restaurants.”

### ✔ Headers (Information about the request)

```
User-Agent: Android App 14.0
Accept: application/json
Authorization: Bearer 948jf-458dj-993fj
```

Headers tell Swiggy server:

* What device you use
* What data format you want
* Whether you are logged in

### ✔ Body

GET request usually has **no body**, so it’s empty.

---

# 🟩 **Server Response (How Swiggy Replies)**

### ✔ Status Code

```
200 OK
```

Meaning:
“Everything went fine!”

### ✔ Response Body (Actual data)

```json
[
  { "rest": "Ovenstory Pizza", "rating": 4.3 },
  { "rest": "Dominos", "rating": 4.2 }
]
```

Your app shows these pizzas on screen.

---

---

# 🟥 **2️⃣ POST Request (Placing an Order)**

Now you click “Order” for a pizza.
This triggers a **POST request**.

### ✔ Request

```
POST /order
```

### ✔ Headers

```
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer 948jf-458dj-993fj
```

### ✔ Body (Actual data you are sending)

```json
{
  "user_id": 101,
  "item": "Farmhouse Pizza",
  "quantity": 1,
  "address": "Chennai - 600028"
}
```

Meaning:
“Here is my order. Please place it.”

---

# 🟩 **Server Response (Swiggy Replies Back)**

### ✔ Status Code

```
201 CREATED
```

Meaning:
“Your order is successfully placed.”

### ✔ Response Body

```json
{
  "order_id": 56789,
  "status": "Order Confirmed",
  "delivery_time": "30 minutes"
}
```

Your phone shows:
**“Order Confirmed! Rider will arrive in 30 minutes.”**

---

# 🟧 **3️⃣ If something goes wrong…**

For example:
Your internet is slow or address missing.

### ✔ Example Response

```
400 BAD REQUEST
```

Body:

```json
{
  "error": "Address cannot be empty"
}
```

Or restaurant is offline:
